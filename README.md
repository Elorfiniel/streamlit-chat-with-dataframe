# Streamlit App - Chat with DataFrame

This project is a Streamlit application that allows users to interact with `pandas` DataFrames through natural language queries. The app leverages large language models (LLMs) to interpret user questions and generate appropriate `pandas` code to manipulate and analyze the provided DataFrame. Users can upload their own CSV data and ask questions about it using conversational language, making data analysis more accessible without requiring deep knowledge of `pandas` syntax.

## Installation Steps

1. Install `uv` by following [the official installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

2. Sync the dependencies by running `uv sync`.

4. Run the Streamlit app via `streamlit run app.py`.

This will start the application locally, and you can access it through your web browser at the provided URL (typically something like `http://localhost:xxxx`).
